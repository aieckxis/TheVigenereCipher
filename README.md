# The Vigenère Cipher
This repository contains a Python script that performs encryption and decryption using the Vigenère Cipher, where the key is a keyword that stands for any one of the letters from 0 to 25. The message is written on one row (letters 0–25) and the keyword is repeatedly written below it. The script adds each column and modifies the result by 26 to obtain ciphertext.
# Improvements
The code has been updated with changes to the code structure, input validation, and output messages from Assignment 2, Problem 3. The script uses a number of functions to make code easier to read and maintain.
The script has also been Git version controlled, with numerous commits including helpful notes during the development process. This makes it simple to monitor changes and advancements over time.
# Conclusion
This Vigenère Cipher script has been updated and improved in order to produce better results overall. Additionally, the usage of Git has improved the tracking and management of the code development process.
